#Work Plan
####Submit a separate plan.md file that describes how you will divide work among your team members, and describe any internal deadlines you will meet to ensure a high quality product for Milestone B. Your team responsibilities may overlap, but one person should be principally responsible for each artifact of your project. We suggest, but do not enforce, that you update the plan document as you continue working on the project.
